                    About me! 
           <br/> <br/> 
           Hey! I'm Dani. Here's my brief background and fun facts about me: I was adopted from Hunan Province, China, into a loving family. My favorite food is steak frites from Burdicks!
           And a few fears of mine are heights and spiders. Now we can get into the present!
           I am a freshman studying computer and electrical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
            I previously graduated from Bellows Falls Union High School and enrolled in a pre-college program for my senior year at Vermont State University (VTSU).
            At VTSU, I really got a preview of college life by living in a dorm room, eating in the dining hall, and walking to classes!
            I met many great people and professors there, which ultimately made me excited about college the upcoming year.
            I also love to draw, play a variety of games, and spend time with my family! (To the left, you can see my family and pets.)
